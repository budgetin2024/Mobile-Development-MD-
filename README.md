Welcome to Budgetin App

BACKGROUNDER:
BUDGETin: Budget Better, Life Better is a personal finance management application aimed at improving Indonesia's financial literacy rate, currently at 65.43% (OJK, 2024). It simplifies financial management by enabling users to track income and expenses, set spending alerts, and achieve financial goals. The app leverages Machine Learning (ML), Mobile Development (MD), and Cloud Computing (CC) technologies to offer predictive financial insights and seamless user experiences.

Learning Path Contributions:
Machine Learning (ML): Our team built a model using TensorFlow to analyze financial data, predict spending trends, and offer personalized budgeting recommendations. The ML component preprocesses data, handles missing values, and generates actionable insights for users. The model is integrated into the app using TensorFlow.js for in-app execution.

Mobile Development (MD): We developed a native Android application using Kotlin in Android Studio. The app features expense tracking, budget categorization, and goal-setting tools. TensorFlow Lite was deployed for on-device predictions, ensuring quick responses. Firebase real-time database integration supports data synchronization even during internet disruptions.

Cloud Computing (CC): We implemented a secure and scalable backend using Node.js and Express.js, integrated with Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for storage and analytics. The app uses Firebase for real-time interaction, along with RESTful APIs for efficient data processing. Logging and monitoring are managed via a custom-built dashboard for service availability and performance.

Conclusion:
By combining ML, MD, and CC, BUDGETin empowers users with tools to manage personal finances efficiently. The app has undergone comprehensive testing for accuracy, usability, and performance, ensuring a reliable platform for users. With predictive features and an intuitive interface, BUDGETin aims to significantly enhance financial literacy and decision-making across Indonesia.
